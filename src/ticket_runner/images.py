"""A project's picture, kept on this machine and kept in step with the board.

A project page already has two pictures, and Notion's own: the **cover**, the
banner across the top of the page, and the **icon**, the emoji or small image in
front of its title. Those are what the console shows — a thumbnail in the list,
a banner on the page — rather than a `Files` column added for the purpose: the
pictures people have already chosen for their pages are then the ones they see,
and a picture changed in either place is changed in both without a column to
keep in step with a cover.

Three things make that harder than showing a URL.

**A file Notion hosts is behind a URL that expires within the hour.** Handed to
a browser, it works on Monday morning and is a broken image by lunch. So no such
URL leaves this module: what the console is given is its own address,
`/api/projects/<id>/image/cover`, and what answers it is a copy on disk under
the state directory. The copy is fetched again when it can no longer be trusted
— the page was edited since, or the picture is another one — and a URL whose
hour is up is never tried: the page is read again for a fresh one.

**A picture changed here has to reach Notion, and may not.** The network is
down, the integration may not update pages. What was chosen is then kept as a
*pending* change, shown here as if it had landed, and sent again at the next
reading of the board. Nothing is lost, and nothing is shown that was not asked.

**A change comes back.** What the console writes, Notion answers with, and the
next reading of the board finds it again. Taken for somebody else's change, it
would be downloaded again — or, worse, a pending change would be settled
against itself. So a picture is *agreed* on, the way `sync.py` stamps a page:
what the board said last time we agreed, by an identity that does not change
with each signature Notion puts on a URL. A reading that finds the agreed
picture finds nothing new; only a reading that finds another one has seen
somebody move. And the page the board answers a write with is agreed on at
once, so a change is never read back as news.

When both moved between two readings — a change is still pending here, and the
page shows another picture than the one agreed — the newest wins, as in
`storage.conflict = "newest"`: the pending change's own time against the
page's `last_edited_time`. Which side won is kept, and the console says it.
