"""What a message to the workspace carries besides its words.

The session on the other side is Claude Code, and Claude Code does not take a
file in a request: it reads one from the disk, with the same tool it reads
source with. So an attachment is never *sent* anywhere. It is written to a
folder of the conversation, under the runner's state — not in a repository,
where it would end up in somebody's commit — and the message names its absolute
path, with a word on how to look at it.

That word is not the same for every kind of file, and it is the whole of the
difference:

- an **image** or a **PDF** is read as it is: the Read tool shows the first and
  pages through the second;
- a **video** is not something the session can watch. When `ffmpeg` is here, a
  handful of frames are drawn from it and those are what it looks at; when it
  is not, the message says so, so that the answer does too instead of guessing
  what was in the clip;
- **anything else** — a spreadsheet, a Word file, a CSV — is a file on a
  machine where the session has a shell, which is enough.

What is accepted is a list, and a short one, rather than "whatever was dropped":
this folder is served back to the page for its thumbnails, and a file the
console never meant to hold — an HTML page, an SVG — would be served from the
console's own origin.

The files belong to one conversation and leave with it: a new conversation
empties the folder, and whatever a conversation nobody closed left behind goes
after `web.attachment_days`.
