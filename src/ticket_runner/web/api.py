"""What the console can ask for, and what it is allowed to change.

The board stays Notion's. Nothing here is a second database: a ticket read is a
ticket read from Notion, a ticket moved is a `PATCH` on the same page you would
have dragged with your thumb. The console adds what Notion cannot do — the live
steps of a running session, the CLI, and a conversation about the whole
workspace — and duplicates nothing it already does well.

Three reads are cached, because a page left open in a tab must not turn into a
full-time reader of your workspace: the configuration (reloaded when its file
changes), the project index, and the tickets database ID. The tickets
themselves are held too, and brought up to date by what changed — how, and why
a move from the console waits in a queue rather than in the browser, is
`board.py`'s to say. So is a ticket's page, while Notion says it has not been
edited — see `Api._brief`.
