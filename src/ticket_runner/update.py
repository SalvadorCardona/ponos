"""Keeping the installation on the latest version, with nobody asking for it.

The runner already wakes up on a timer, so it does not need a second one: a run
looks at the clock before it looks at the tickets, and once an hour it asks the
remote whether the installed code is still the newest. One `git fetch` in the
install directory answers that — which is why `install.sh` *clones* the
repository there rather than unpacking a tarball. "Am I up to date" is a
question git already knows how to answer; a version number in a file would only
be a second, less truthful copy of it.

An update lands **between** two runs, never inside one. The check happens under
the run lock and before a single ticket is claimed, so no session is ever
swapped out from under itself; the code that just landed takes over on the next
pass, which is at most one interval away.

The console is the exception, and `restart_console` is why: it is one process
that answers for weeks, so nothing about it takes over on its own.

What "the newest" means is `runner.update_channel`, and the default is the
careful one: **the newest release**, a `vX.Y.Z` tag. Following `main` meant
that every commit pushed there — a runner opens its own pull requests, and
merges the ones you validate — was running on every installation within the
hour, before anybody had called it a version. A tag is somebody saying "this
one"; `main` stays available for whoever wants every commit as it lands. No tag
at all is not a reason to fall back on `main`: nothing is updated, and the run
says why.

A release is only ever a step *forward*. An installation already ahead of the
newest tag — a clone of `main` that has just been switched to the release
channel — is left where it is rather than taken back to the tag.

An installation made from a local copy (`TR_SRC=.`) has no remote to compare
itself against. That is not an error and never fails a run — it is said once,
and the runner carries on.

**Each version has a directory of its own, and `app` is a link to one of them.**
On 30 September 2026 a pass started while an update was rewriting `app` in
place: it imported a `files.py` already new and a `store.py` still old, and died
on `ImportError: cannot import name 'SLOTS'`. The run lock could not have
prevented it — a process imports its modules before it ever asks for the lock.
So nothing in use is written to any more: the new version is copied beside the
old one as `app-<commit>`, checked, and `app` is moved onto it by one rename.
The launcher resolves the link once, when it starts, so a process imports every
module from the one version it found, however long it runs. The version it
replaced stays on disk — for what is still running on it, and for going back.
