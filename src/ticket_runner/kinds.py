"""What kind of work a ticket is, decided before any of it is done.

For a long time the question answered itself: a ticket whose project had a
repository came back as a pull request, and every other one as a text in its
own page. Then tickets started asking for things that are neither — enter these
DNS records at the registrar, post this on LinkedIn, deploy that — and those do
not have the same road, nor the same way of going wrong. A pull request is read
before it is merged; a post, once it is out, is out.

So a ticket has a **type**, and there are four, told apart by the road they
take rather than by what they are about:

- `code` — a repository, a branch, a pull request;
- `writing` — no repository, the answer is written into the page;
- `external` — no repository either, the work is done somewhere else: in the
  browser, in a DNS zone, in the settings of a service. It stops at the first
  doubt, and its answer is the log of what it did;
- `publication` — something public and irreversible. Prepared first, sent to
  review, and only published once somebody has moved it to *Validated*.

The column is optional, and empty is a request: work it out. A short session on
the lightest model reads the title, the content and whether the project has a
repository, and answers in JSON — a type, a sentence saying why, how sure it is,
and the type it hesitated with. It runs in the pass's own thread, like the one
that names a nameless ticket, so it neither starts anything alongside the
sessions in flight nor holds one of their places for longer than it takes to
answer a question.

What is done with that answer is the point of the module, and it is decided
here, in code, rather than left to the model: **a doubt is never settled by
running the ticket.** A guess that is not sure enough, or that hesitated between
a harmless type and one of the two that act on the world, blocks the ticket
with the question — and the type is left empty, for you to choose, rather than
written on the page as though somebody had chosen it. When the session itself
has to choose, it is told to take the more careful of the two; see `PRUDENCE`.

Below is a ticket that a runner is about to carry out on its own. Before it \
does, say what kind of ticket it is. Do not do the ticket, and do not open \
anything: read it and classify it.

The four types are told apart by how the work is carried out, not by its \
subject:

- "code": the deliverable is a change in a code repository — a branch and a \
pull request. Documentation that lives in the repository is code too.
- "writing": there is no repository to change; the deliverable is a text \
written back into the ticket — an answer, a draft, a piece of research.
- "external": the work is done outside, by acting on something: in a browser, \
in a DNS zone, in the settings of a third-party service. No repository.
- "publication": something goes out in public and cannot be taken back — a \
post on a social network, a deployment, an email or a message sent.

When two types fit, choose the more careful one: publication before external, \
external before code, code before writing. A ticket that asks to draft a post \
AND to publish it is a publication; one that only asks for the draft is writing.
