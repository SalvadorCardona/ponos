"""Markdown, turned into Notion blocks.

Only what an agent actually writes in a plan: headings, lists, checkboxes,
quotes, code fences, dividers, paragraphs, and inline bold, italic, code and
links. Nested lists are flattened — a plan reads perfectly well flat, and one
level of children would double the size of this file for very little.

Anything unrecognised falls through as a paragraph, which is the right failure:
the text always reaches the page, at worst without its formatting.
