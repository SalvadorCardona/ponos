"""Which model a ticket runs on when nobody said.

A ticket with no Model used to run on `runner.model`, which in practice is the
heaviest model there is — for “remove that paragraph” as much as for “audit the
whole repository”. The light ones would have done the first in a minute, for a
fraction of the credit.

So an empty Model is a request, like an empty Type: work it out. Not by asking
a model, though, and that is the decision this module stands on. A choice that
costs a session is a choice that has to earn back what it spends before it
saves anything, and its reason is whatever the session felt like writing. A few
rules read off the ticket cost nothing, give the same answer twice, and say
exactly why — which is the part that gets a wrong choice corrected rather than
put up with:

- **the type** gives the starting point, one level per type, set in the
  configuration (`auto_model_code`…): a text starts lighter than a change to a
  repository;
- **the size** moves it: a short request stays where it is, one of ordinary
  size is at least standard, a long one — or one with many steps — goes up one;
  and a request that only asks to remove, rename or reword something, said in
  its title and not drowned in a long body, drops to the lightest level;
- **the words** that announce heavy work — an audit, a migration, a refactor,
  a hard bug — take it to the heavy level, and to the heaviest when the request
  is long as well;
- **the priority**: an urgent ticket never runs on the lightest model, since a
  second attempt is exactly what it cannot afford.

Four levels, and each says which model it is in the configuration — the names
are the configuration's, not this module's, so a runner routed through
OpenRouter names its slugs there and nothing here changes.

**A run that failed goes up one level, once.** A ticket chosen for and failed —
a session that crashed, timed out, went round in circles — is run on the next
level up when it comes back, and the comment says so. Once: a ticket that
failed on the level above too is not a ticket a bigger model will save, and it
stays where it went rather than climbing to the top of the price list. What a
run was chosen and how it ended is read from the local journal (journal.py), so
this works the same on any board.

A Model somebody wrote is never second-guessed, and neither is an agent's: this
only ever fills the gap that `runner.model` used to fill. With one exception,
which is the price list again: **Fable is only run when `runner.use_fable` says
so.** One Fable session cost more than a day of Opus ones, and it arrived
unasked — through the heaviest level, through an escalation, through a Model
left on an old ticket. Off, every one of those runs on Opus instead, whoever
wrote it; see `allowed`.
