"""A minimal Notion client, standard library only.

No SDK: three HTTP verbs and a handful of conversions are enough, and one less
dependency is one less thing that can break the install.

The client reads **the database schema** before writing anything. That is what
lets you rename a column in Notion, or switch `Status` from a status property to
a select, without touching the code: values are encoded according to the
declared type, and a property that does not exist is skipped silently rather
than failing the ticket.

It is one implementation of `store.Store`, and the one everything was written
against — `Page`, `Comment` and `read` are that module's now, re-exported here
because a Notion page is still what they were shaped after.
