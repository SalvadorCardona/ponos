"""Where the board lives, whoever holds it.

The runner was written against Notion, and against nothing else: `notion.Client`
was passed around as *the* way to read a ticket, to write a status, to say
something on a page. That was true for as long as there was one place a board
could be — and it stopped being true the day the answer to "can this run without
Notion?" had to be yes.

So this module is the seam. Three things live here and nothing else:

- **the vocabulary.** `Page`, `Comment`, and `read` — a property reduced to a
  plain Python value. Their shape is Notion's, deliberately: a `Page` carries
  its properties the way the API writes them, and every backend produces that
  same shape rather than a dialect of its own. Which is why `read` is here and
  not in `notion.py` — it decodes what *any* store hands over, and a second
  decoder per backend is the bug nobody would find;
- **the interface.** `Store` says what the rest of the runner may ask of a
  board. It is a `Protocol` rather than a base class, because the fakes the test
  suite is made of are duck-typed and were never going to inherit from anything;
- **the choice.** `open()` reads `[storage]` and hands back the one the
  configuration asked for: Notion as before, Markdown files on disk, or the two
  kept in step. Nothing above this module knows which it got.

What is *not* here is provisioning: creating a database, widening a select,
adding a property. That is Notion's own shape being built, it only ever happens
through `ponos init`, and a Markdown board has none of it — the
directories are made the first time something is written into them.
