"""What an installation from before the rename still carries, carried over.

Ponos was installed for a year under another name: its configuration, its
history, its worktrees and the variables of a unit file were all written under
it. A new version that only knew the new name would start on an empty board
with a blank configuration — nothing deleted, everything out of sight, which is
indistinguishable from lost to whoever is looking. So the first launch moves
what is there, once, and says so in one line.

**This whole module is a migration filet, and only that.** The old name is
spelled here, in `OLD`, and nowhere else in the code; when the filet goes (the
CHANGELOG says in which version), this file goes with it.

Everything is idempotent and cheap when there is nothing to do: one `exists()`
per directory, one pass over the environment. Two processes starting together
— the timer and the console — race on a `rename`, which one of them wins and the
other finds already done.
