"""Who answers a session: the CLI signed in as you, an Anthropic key, or OpenRouter.

On a laptop the question never came up. Claude Code was signed in once with
`claude login`, and every session the runner started was that subscription.
A server is where it does come up: nobody sits at its browser to sign in, a key
is what a server is usually given, and the three ways are not the same thing.

- **`cli`** — the subscription, signed in with `claude login` (in a container,
  from the terminal Dokploy gives you). The only one that keeps Claude in Chrome,
  which loads on an OAuth session and nothing else, and the only one whose
  credits come in windows worth waiting for (credits.py).
- **`api_key`** — an Anthropic key, billed by the token. No browser, nothing to
  wait for.
- **`openrouter`** — the key of `[openrouter]`; with `route_sessions` the
  sessions run there, and a model is an OpenRouter slug. openrouter.py says what
  goes with that.

The choice is `claude.provider`. A file that has none reads the way it always
did — see `chosen` — so an installation nobody touches is not moved anywhere.

The checks below say whether a choice *works*, not merely whether it is filled
in, because a key with a typo in it is found out on the first ticket otherwise —
on a server, hours later, by nobody.
