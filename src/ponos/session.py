"""Running a Claude Code session on a ticket, and knowing what it did.

The session runs in `--print` mode with `stream-json` output: the raw stream is
written to a log as-is, which lets you follow a ticket live
(`ponos logs -f`) and read back afterwards why it failed.

`on_event` sees every event of that stream as it arrives, which is what lets
the runner write the steps into the Notion ticket while they happen.

The session ID is **drawn before** launching and passed as `--session-id`. So we
know it even if the session dies halfway, and `claude --resume <id>` reopens the
conversation exactly where it stopped — which is what makes a failure something
to repair by hand rather than something to redo.
