"""Updating the installation from the console, without cutting anything short.

The runner already updates itself between two runs (`update.between_runs`);
what the console adds is *now*, on a click, with somebody watching. The rules
are the same ones, and for the same reason: the update takes **the run lock**.
Every Claude session a ticket starts runs inside a pass that holds it, so
holding it is the one guarantee that no session is running — and that none
starts while the code is being swapped: the timer's next run finds it busy,
claims nothing, and leaves every ticket where it was. A click while a ticket is
running is therefore not refused, it is *queued*: the update waits for the
lock, says so, and can be called off while it waits.

Nothing the page sends chooses what runs. The endpoint takes no command, no
revision and no path: it asks the remote again, under the lock, what the
channel in the configuration says is the newest, and installs that with the
same `update.install` a run uses — which takes the installation back to the
commit it replaced if the new one does not start.

The console is the one process that has to go: it is restarted last, once the
lock is released and "restarting" has been said, and the page reconnects on its
own to whichever version answers. Under its systemd unit that is the unit's
restart; started by hand, the process replaces itself with the same command
line. What was going on is written down first, so the process that comes back
knows it came back from an update.
