"""The console's HTTP layer: `http.server`, and nothing else.

A tool whose whole claim is "no dependency to install" does not get to grow a
web framework the day it grows a web page. What is here is what the standard
library already offers — a threading HTTP server, a handler, and Server-Sent
Events, which are eight lines and exactly the shape of the problem.

**What is on the other side of this port matters more than the port.** The
runner starts Claude Code sessions with `bypassPermissions`; so does the chat.
Anything that can talk to this server can run code on this machine as you. That
is why:

- the default bind is `127.0.0.1`, and a non-loopback host without a configured
  token — or a configured sign-in — is refused rather than served;
- every request carries a token — as a header, as the cookie the first `?token=`
  sets, or as the cookie signing in with an email and a password sets;
- until somebody has said how this console is opened, there is nothing to carry:
  a console nobody claimed serves the first connection instead (see `setup`),
  and the password typed there is what closes that door — to this machine
  alone, or to whoever has the installation code `serve` printed when it
  started: a console behind a domain is a console the whole Internet reaches
  first;
- behind a proxy that says the browser came in over HTTPS (`X-Forwarded-Proto`),
  every cookie is `Secure`, so it never travels in clear on the way back;
- a request from a browser page that is not the console is rejected: writes
  demand a header a cross-origin form cannot set, and the `Host` header must
  name the address the console was reached on, which is what stops a hostile
  page from resolving its own domain to 127.0.0.1 and talking to you through it.
