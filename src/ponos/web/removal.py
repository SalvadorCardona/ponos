"""Deleting a project from the console, and what that does and does not reach.

A project the console no longer shows is not enough: one that is only hidden is
still on the board, still synchronised, and its ready tickets are still taken by
the runner — which is what spends tokens. So deleting is done where the runner
looks: the project's page goes to the **Notion trash** (thirty days to bring it
back, and every query stops listing it), and what still points at it is dealt
with in the same gesture rather than at the next pass.

What is reached, and what never is, is the whole of the decision:

- **tickets** stay on the board by default, since they are somebody's work;
  those the runner could still pick up (ready, in progress) are put in
  *blocked* with a comment that says why. Trashing them too is an option the
  confirmation offers;
- **the GitHub repository, the clone on this machine and the branches** are not
  ours to remove, and are not touched. The throwaway worktrees under the state
  directory go — except one holding changes nobody committed;
- **the ideas** found for the project are dropped, with their cost. **History**
  (what was spent, how it ended) is kept as it is: the global statistics are a
  sum over it, and a deleted project's spending still happened;
- a **`[projects]` line** of the configuration naming it goes too, otherwise the
  project would come straight back as one "from the configuration".

A session running on one of its tickets refuses the deletion. Stopping a session
from here would be a second gesture hidden in the first one.
