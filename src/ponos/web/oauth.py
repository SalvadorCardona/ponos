"""Who may talk to the MCP server, and with which of its two keys.

The console's own way in — its token, a cookie, a password — opens everything:
behind it sits a runner that starts sessions with `bypassPermissions`. The MCP
server is a narrower door, and it gets keys of its own rather than a copy of
those: a key that can only read, and one that can also write, each handed to
one client and taken back from that client alone.

**OAuth 2.1, because that is what a remote connector speaks.** claude.ai adds
a connector by its address and nothing else: it reads where to authorise from
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, registers itself (RFC 7591), sends you
to `/oauth/authorize`, and exchanges the code it gets back for a token —
with PKCE, so that a code intercepted on its way back is worth nothing. The
same flow the Leadz connector already goes through, and the one the MCP
specification names. Only what that road needs is here: the `code` grant with
`S256`, refresh tokens that turn over at each use, and no implicit flow, no
password grant, no client credentials.

**Consent is the console's sign-in.** Registering is open — any client may
say its name — and worth nothing on its own: the authorisation page asks for
the console's password (or its token) unless the browser is already signed in,
and says which client asks for what. Read is always granted; write is ticked,
or not.

**A token for Claude Code without a browser.** `ponos mcp token` draws one on
this machine, for one name and one scope, and it does not expire: it is taken
back with `ponos mcp revoke`. Claude Code can also go through OAuth like
claude.ai does — this is for when a header in a file is simpler.

Nothing secret is stored as itself. A code, a token or a client secret is kept
as its SHA-256: reading the database tells which client holds a key, never the
key. Every check compares digests.
