"""The configuration file, described well enough for a browser to draw it.

`config.toml` is the single source of truth and stays a file you can open in an
editor. What this module adds is a *description* of it — one entry per key, with
the label, the sentence of help and the type — so the console can offer the same
settings without a second idea of what a setting is.

Three rules hold the whole thing together.

- **The file's own words, not the loader's.** A field shows what the file says;
  the value the runner would use when the file says nothing is shown beside it,
  greyed, as a placeholder. That is the difference between "you chose thirty
  minutes" and "nobody said, so thirty minutes it is" — and it is why clearing a
  field *removes the line* rather than writing an empty one.
- **A secret is never sent to the browser.** A token goes out as "set, ending in
  …f3a2" and comes back only when you type a new one. Clearing one is a gesture
  of its own, so that an empty field can keep meaning "leave it alone". Nor is
  it written to `config.toml`: `config.edit` puts it in `secrets.env`.
- **Nothing the browser says is trusted.** Every value is checked here against
  the same rules the loader applies — the floors, the three merge methods, the
  three events — and the file itself is loaded before the save is allowed to
  stand. See `config.edit`.

Adding a setting to `config.py` and not here is caught by the test suite: a key
the console cannot reach is a key that quietly stops existing.
