"""The board as the console holds it, between two answers from Notion.

The console used to reread the whole tickets database every fifteen seconds.
That was always *right* — a full read cannot miss anything — and it was slow in
the way that shows: 366 tickets are four pages of a hundred, four seconds of
Notion, so a status changed in Notion reached the screen fifteen to twenty
seconds later, and a move made from the console was a `PATCH` the browser sat
through, lost for good if Notion answered 429 at that moment. Three things
replace it, and each is here because of something measured on the real board:

- **a read is what changed, with a window that overlaps.** Notion's
  `last_edited_time` is rounded down to the minute: four statuses written at
  :06, :22, :39 and :52 all came back as `09:32:00.000Z`. A read of "edited
  after my last read" would skip every change made in the minute of that read.
  So the window reaches `OVERLAP` seconds further back than the last read, pages
  come back more than once, and what was already held is recognised by its
  properties rather than by a timestamp that cannot tell them apart;
- **the whole board is still read, every `RECONCILE` seconds and at the start.**
  An incremental read cannot see a page leave — an archived ticket just stops
  coming back — and a window can be wrong in ways nobody thought of. The full
  read is the truth; what it finds that the reads before it had wrong is an
  *écart*, counted, shown in the console and written in the journal, which is
  how anybody will know whether the window is wide enough;
- **a move from the console is a write that waits its turn.** `Outbox` keeps it
  on disk until Notion has it: it reads the page first and refuses to overwrite
  a status somebody changed in Notion since the console showed it, retries with
  a growing wait (Notion's own `Retry-After` is honoured one layer down, in
  `notion.Client`), reads the page back to confirm, and until then the card says
  "waiting to be sent" — or, when it gave up, why.

One more thing was measured, and it is why a confirmed write is *held* for a few
seconds: a database query sees a `PATCH` one to four seconds after the `PATCH`
answered. A read in between would put the card back where it came from.

Everything written down goes to the same journal as the Markdown mirror's
reconciliation (`sync_journal` in `ponos.db`, `ponos sync --journal`): one place to ask
"when did this ticket change, and when did the other side see it?".
