"""The question a blocked ticket asks, and what an answer to it means.

A blocked report used to be the session's last sentence, posted as it came,
with the same footer under every one of them — *yes, no, or a sentence*. It
read as a paragraph on a phone, and it never said what the question *was*: on
the day a pull request was ready and only the merge was forbidden, nobody could
tell whether “yes” meant *merge it* or *I will*. So the session no longer writes
the comment. It hands over the parts — what is done, why it stops, the question,
and **which kind of answer it wants** — and the runner lays them out, one line
each, the same way every time:

- **yes-no**, when one word is enough to carry on, and the question is put so
  that “yes” means *go ahead*;
- **choice**, two to four concrete roads, numbered, so that “2” is an answer;
- **free**, when no option makes sense, and the question says what to give.

The other half is reading the answer back, and that is why the kind is worth
asking for: “2”, « la 2 », “ok” or a sentence all arrive as a comment, and a
comment is read by the next session minutes later, with no idea what “2”
referred to. `read` ties it to the option it names, and the run carries the
question along with it — see `Reports.discussion`.

The question is not kept anywhere but in the comment itself. A report the
runner can read back is a report that still means something after a restart, on
another machine, or on a board mirrored to Markdown files — so `found` reads the
layout `Voice.question` writes, and nothing else.
