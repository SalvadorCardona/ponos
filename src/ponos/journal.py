"""Every run, and every step of it, kept where the console can ask for them.

A run's detail used to have two homes, and neither was right for it. The
ticket's page got a bullet per tool call, until a ticket became a log nobody
reads twice — and a page rewritten every ten seconds, which is a page no cache
can keep (see progress.py, which now writes only what the agent says). The
session's `.jsonl` holds everything, but as a stream: the console read a whole
file to show its last thousand lines, could not page back through it, and knew
of no run but by its file name.

So each run is a row of the local database (db.py) and each step a row under
it, written as the session goes: what the console's « live » section reads,
page by page, for the run going on and for every run before it, and what
`ponos logs` looks a ticket's runs up in. It sits beside the board, not on it:
a Notion board, a Markdown one or both are written by a run the same way, and
the journal is the same for the three.

**A step is what `progress.describe` makes of an event**, the same reading the
page and the console have always used: what the agent said, which tool it
called on what, which call failed. Not the payload — what a command printed, a
file's content — which stays in the `.jsonl`, the complete record; a row is the
line you scan, the log is what you open once you know where to look.

**It never fails a ticket.** Every write is caught, and a database that refuses
one switches the journal off for the rest of the run: the session goes on, and
its log holds everything all the same.

A run's `status` is what the ticket came to — done, blocked, failed, waiting —
not only what its session did: a session that ended well and committed nothing
is a blocked ticket, and that is what its run says. `reason` is the sentence
beside it, or the pull request it opened. A run the runner never got to close
— killed mid-session — keeps a NULL status, and reads as such.
