"""The pure part of ponos, under assertions.

    python3 tests/run.py

No framework and no dependency, for the same reason the runner has none: a test
suite that needs an install is a test suite that stops being run. Everything
here is pure — nothing touches Notion, git, the network or the disk beyond a
temporary file.

What is covered is what has already gone wrong once, or would go wrong silently:
identifiers that collide, a status name that does not exist, markdown that
reaches Notion as a wall of text, a summary that keeps its verdict.
