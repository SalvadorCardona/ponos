# What the container does when it starts — the image's install.sh, run each time.
#
# A configuration when the volume has none yet: the example, with the three
# lines a container answers differently — the projects under /workspace, the
# console listening to the network Docker gives it (the installation code
# guards it until somebody claims it, see web/setup.py), and a run every minute,
# since a pass with nothing to do is one request to the board.
#
# Then git signed in through gh when a token was given, so a push goes out as
# the account the pull requests are opened as. And then the two halves of a
# runner: the loop of runs the systemd timer would start (`ponos run --every`),
# and the console in the foreground, whose logs are the container's — the
# installation code among them.
#
# Given a command, the container runs that instead: `docker compose run ponos
# ponos doctor`, or the CI's test suite.
