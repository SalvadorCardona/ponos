/* Everything the console knows, in three places.
 *
 * The hand-written console kept a `state` object at the top of its single file
 * and mutated it. This is the same object, held by React so that the parts of
 * the page that care about a field redraw when it changes and the rest do not.
 *
 * Three contexts rather than one, because the fields do not move at the same
 * speed. A running session writes ten steps a second; the board moves every
 * few seconds at most; whether the stream is up and which sessions are running
 * changes a few times an hour. With one context, every step redrew the menu,
 * the board, the settings and the drawer — so the steps have a context of
 * their own, the connection and the list of sessions another, and the rest a
 * third, each value built once per change rather than once per render.
 *
 * The rule underneath is unchanged and is the reason this is a stream and not a
 * store: a click posts and says nothing. What lands here is what came back on
 * `/api/events`, so two open tabs agree, and an answer typed on a phone shows up
 * on the laptop without either of them asking.
