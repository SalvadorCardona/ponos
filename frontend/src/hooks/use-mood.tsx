/* What the runner is doing, as a face.
 *
 * Read off what the console already holds — the stream's connection, the
 * sessions the server says are running, the board, the runner's state — and
 * nothing asked of the server for it. Most of it is a state: a session is
 * running or it is not. Two of it are events, and the board only says them
 * by changing: a ticket that has just come back (its pull request opened, or
 * it reached review or done) makes the robot jump for a few seconds, and one
 * that has just fallen into blocked leaves it sad for a few minutes — long
 * enough to be seen by somebody who looks up, short enough not to mourn a
 * ticket forever. The first board a page reads is remembered, not reacted to:
 * a ticket blocked yesterday is not news.
 *
 * Read once, for the whole console, and handed down. One face shows it now —
 * the mark, in the menu's corner on a wide screen and in the bar on a phone:
 * the bar's end had a second one, and lost it for being one more thing in a
 * row that already says the stream, the version and the sync.
