/* Numbers, amounts and plurals, in the language the console is in.
 *
 * A number is not a sentence either: no dictionary can say that 2734.75 is
 * « 2 734,75 $ » in French and "$2,734.75" in English, or that French has one
 * ticket at 0 and English has none. `Intl` knows both, so the console asks it
 * rather than writing `toFixed(2)` in a few places and "ticket(s)" in all the
 * others — a "(s)" is a plural nobody bothered to choose.
 *
 * The locale is a module-level value, set by `i18n.ts` whenever the language
 * changes, so that a caller says `money(n)` and nothing more. This module
 * imports nothing, so that `node --test` reads it as it stands, like
 * `composer.ts`; what `count` returns is the English sentence and its
 * parameters, translated where it is drawn, like `thinking.ts`.
