/* A session read in its broad lines: what the agent said, each with the steps
 * that followed it folded under it.
 *
 * The journal of a session is two kinds of line in one list — a sentence, then
 * twelve `Bash`, an `Error`, three `Read`, a sentence — and read as it stands it
 * is the twelve `Bash` that take the screen. What somebody watching a ticket
 * wants is the sentences: they say what the agent is about, and the tool calls
 * after one are how it went about it. So each sentence heads a group, and the
 * calls up to the next sentence are that group's, to be opened when wanted.
 *
 * A group's key is where its first step stands in the run — the journal's
 * `position`, or the place in the stream where there is none — and not its
 * index on screen: older steps read on request are put *before* the ones held,
 * and a stream forgets its oldest, and either would otherwise move every key and
 * fold again whatever the reader had opened.
 *
 * This module imports nothing, so that `node --test` reads it as it stands,
 * like `composer.ts` and `thinking.ts`.
