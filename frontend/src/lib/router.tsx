 * Everything the page shows is named in the query string, because the server
 * behind it is `http.server` and the standard library: `/` is the one page it
 * serves, and a deep path would be a 404 before the JavaScript had a chance
 * to read it. So the board is `/?view=console/tickets/list`, a ticket is
 * `/?view=console/tickets/read/<id>`, one section of the settings is
 * `/?view=console/settings/read/config/notify` — the shape react-resource-view
 * writes in its `query` routing mode.
 *
 * TanStack Router holds the history, and `react-resource-view/tanstack` is how
 * the views reach it. One route, the root: the package resolves the address
 * into a resource itself, and a route tree would say the same thing twice.

/* The query string, handed back exactly as it was written.
 *
 * TanStack reparses the search into an object and writes it back out before
 * anybody reads `searchStr`. Its default writer would turn
 * `view=console/tickets/list` into `view=console%2Ftickets%2Flist` — and
 * react-resource-view says which menu entry is lit by comparing the address to
 * the links it built, character for character. So the string the object was
 * read from is kept beside it and is what goes back out — and an object the
 * router built itself is written the way the package writes, slashes left as
 * slashes. */

/* A pane that has since become a resource, and the address it is now at.

 * `/?page=projects` and `/?page=schedules` were pages of their own before those
 * two were lists you open a record from, and `/?page=live` and `/?page=context`
 * were until the console moved onto the package's admin layout; a link
 * somebody bookmarked or pasted into a chat has to keep landing on them rather
 * than on the board. The live page has since gone altogether — a session is
 * followed on its ticket, and the running tickets are on the board — so
 * `/?page=live` leads to the board. Written out rather than generated: this
 * module is what the resources address themselves through, and importing one
 * from here would be a circle.
