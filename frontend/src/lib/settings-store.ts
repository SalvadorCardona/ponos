/* The configuration, as the server last described it.
 *
 * The settings page is a resource with one sub-page per group, and a sub-page
 * is declared before anything has been fetched — `subViewResource` is read off
 * the view as the tabs are drawn. So the description has to be reachable from
 * outside React: `getItem` writes it here, the tab list reads it back, and the
 * page stays what it has always been — drawn from what the server says the
 * configuration holds, never from a list kept in the console.
 *
 * Four other things live here for the same reason.
 *
 * A *draft* is what you have typed on a page and not saved. Only one page is
 * mounted at a time — that is the whole point of tabs — so a form leaving the
 * screen would otherwise take your edits with it. It writes them here instead,
 * under its group, and reads them back on the way in.
 *
 * The *revision*, which is how a save reaches the pages it did not touch: every
 * form is keyed by it, so a fresh description redraws them all — previews,
 * defaults and what the file now states included.
 *
 * Whether the *keys* are shown: a choice of whoever reads the page, kept with
 * the browser like the theme, and read by every field at once.
 *
 * And what a search, or an old link to a section, *asked for*: the page it
 * leads to is mounted after the click, and unfolds and scrolls to it then.
