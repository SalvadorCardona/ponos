/* Markdown, read rather than shown — what `components/console/markdown.tsx`
 * draws, decided without a DOM.
 *
 * It is not a markdown engine: it knows the shapes `notion.blocks_text` writes,
 * the same shapes a Markdown board holds as files, and the few more a session
 * reaches for — a nested list, a table, a word behind a link, an emphasis — and
 * nothing else. It returns plain data, never markup: the page hands every
 * string to React, which escapes it.
 *
 * It lives here, importing nothing, so that `node --test` can hold it to what
 * it says; three shapes came out as their own source before it could — a
 * numbered list read « 1. 1. 1. », a table its pipes, a bold holding a bit of
 * code its asterisks.
