/* Whom an idea is for: the project's icon and name, or the workspace.
 *
 * Said the same way on the Ideas page and on the cards of the swipe, so it is
 * drawn once. The icon is the one every other place shows — `ProjectThumb`, the
 * page's icon in Notion — found in the list the console already holds. An idea
 * files its project under the bare page id and the list may carry dashes, hence
 * the comparison without them. A project the list no longer knows is named by
 * what the caller still has, and drawn with its initial.
