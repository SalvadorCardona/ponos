/* The discussion, behind a bubble.

 * It used to be a column: half the screen given to a conversation whether or
 * not there was one, an entry in the menu to reach it on a phone, and a switch
 * in the bar to fold it away — three places to learn for one thing to open. A
 * bubble in the bottom corner is the gesture everybody already knows, and the
 * page keeps its full width until you ask for the conversation.
 *
 * What it opens is what you are looking at: on a ticket, that ticket's
 * discussion; anywhere else, the workspace's own. Same rule as the column it
 * replaces, and the same two panes — only the way in changed.
