/* Ponos, the mascot, as the console draws it.
 *
 * The drawing is not here: it is `docs/mascot/ponos-robot.js`, a Web
 * Component in vanilla JavaScript because the landing page has no build step,
 * and bundled into the console as it stands. What this adds is what a page of
 * React needs around it — the theme the console is in rather than the one the
 * system prefers, and nothing for a screen reader to trip over.
 *
 * Every robot here is decoration. What it means is always said beside it in
 * words — a column's name, a sentence in the bar — so it is hidden from
 * assistive technology rather than labelled twice.
