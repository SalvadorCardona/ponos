/* One thing that was said, by you or by the other side.
 *
 * shadcn's `Message` lays it out — yours against the right edge, theirs against
 * the left — and `Bubble` draws the surface it is said on, so the palette is the
 * one the components already carry: a problem reads red, the workspace reads as
 * a card, and what you said is tinted with the accent so a transcript can be
 * skimmed for your own turns.
 *
 * What is inside is markdown, because both sides write markdown: a session
 * answers in headings and lists and fenced code, and a bubble that showed the
 * source of that would be asking a reader to parse it themselves.
 *
 * Who said it and when are one line, set in the mono face: they are a stamp on
 * the message, not a sentence in it. What Ponos says — in the console as on a
 * ticket — is signed with its name and its face, the one the sidebar wears:
 * at that size the robot draws its head alone.
 *
 * The words are a step larger and heavier than the console's small print:
 * they are what a reader came for, and the regular weight read thin in the
 * dark theme.
 *
 * What came with it — a screenshot, a clip, a PDF — sits above the words, the
 * way it was written: the file first, then what is to be said about it.
 *
 * Memoised, because a turn once said does not change: the board redraws the
 * console every few seconds, and a transcript of forty turns used to be drawn
 * again with it, every one of them, to say the same thing.
