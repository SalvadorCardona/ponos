/* The console in a browser, against a real `ponos serve`.
 *
 * `e2e/console.py` starts it on a board of Markdown files it writes itself, so
 * the tests need python3 and nothing of yours. The browser is the Chrome
 * already on the machine — GitHub's runners have one too — rather than one
 * Playwright downloads: `npm ci` stays an install of packages, not of browsers.
 *
 * Three servers, not one. A console holds a single conversation with the
 * workspace, so a turn `chat.spec.ts` leaves running is a turn every other test
 * that opens the console walks into: Escape there stops it instead of closing
 * the drawer, and the chat test then reads "stopped by you" where its answer
 * should be. The chat gets a server of its own, its tests one after another;
 * the rest share the other one and run in parallel. The ideas share the chat's: what
 * they keep is written onto its board, and the others count the tickets of theirs. And the first connection
 * gets a console nobody has claimed, which its test claims — once. And the tests that
delete projects get one of their own, with two projects to spare: the others count them.
 *
 * The ports are free ones unless `PONOS_E2E_PORT` names the first (the
 * chat takes the next, the first connection the one after, deleting the last): two worktrees running these tests at once must not both
 * ask for 8790. They are kept in the environment because Playwright reads this
 * file again in every worker, and a worker that drew its own would knock on a
 * port nobody serves.
